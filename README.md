# Support Vector Machine and Its Applications

This repository contains the project report, code, and results of our research on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) applied to diverse classification tasks. The project explores the versatility of SVMs in handling tasks across different domains, demonstrating their effectiveness through practical implementations.


## Overview:
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful tools for classification problems, leveraging mathematical concepts like hyperplanes and kernels. This project focuses on the application of SVMs to four distinct domains:

Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews:
Accuracy: 89.27%
Feature extraction using TF-IDF.

Classification of Real vs AI-Generated Images:
Accuracy: 85.12%
Feature extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).

Hand Gesture Recognition:
Accuracy: 89.85%
Multiclass classification using HOG and a Sigmoid kernel.

Medical Image Classification:
Accuracy: 96%
Classification of chest X-rays into normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 categories using HOG features.


## Key Features:
Implementation of four SVM kernels: Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoid.
Use of advanced feature extraction techniques like HOG and TF-IDF for robust data representation.
Comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
